Most influence mapping projects start with a common set of questions and challenges.Â  This toolbox helps project leaders navigate them.

## Plan

Projects usually start with an intuition or question that the project leaders think that network data can support. At this stage, a little bit of planning goes a long way.

## Collect
Questions to think about before you build and organize your dataset.

How to [find the right data](find-data-sources.html) sources and determine if they are right for you.
How to [collect data](collect-data.html)?
How to [clean the data](clean-data.html) and put in a format that's usable for your purpose?
How to [verify and control the quality of the data](verify-data.html)?
